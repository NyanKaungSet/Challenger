                    <p style="padding-top:10px;">We are from Myanmar(formly known as Burma). Myanmar is a Southeast Asian nation of more than 100 ethnic groups, bordering India, Bangladesh, China, Laos and Thailand. Yangon (formerly Rangoon), the country's largest city, is home to bustling markets, numerous parks and lakes, and the towering, gilded Shwedagon Pagoda, which contains Buddhist relics and dates to the 6th century.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">What Is Happening in Myanmar?</h2><hr style="width:50%;margin:auto;">
                <p style="padding: 20px;text-align: center; width: 90%;margin: auto;font-size: 20px;">A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of 1 February 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmar's military—which then vested power in a military junta. According to AAPP(Asssistance Association For Political Prisoners) 1735 people are now killed by Terroist Myanmar Military. The actual number of fatalities is likely much higher. Junta group destroyed many villages using helicopters, jet fighters, artilleries and rockets. While people leave the villages, soldiers burned down the houses, crops and livestocks. Many people INCLUDING children, even babies are killed. And China, Russia are supporting terrorist Myanmar Military. Shame on you, Russia and China!<br>However, UN still didn't take any ACTION. Always hold "close door" meetings but didn't do anything that can help Myanmar. And ASEAN, it becomes Association of Sitting, Eating And Nothing. Didn't take any action. They even invited the leader of terrorists Army. We are very disappointed.</p><hr>
